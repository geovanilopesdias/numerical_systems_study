# Study of Numeric Systems

In order to apply my studies on convertion between numerical systems (binary, octal and hexadecimal) and the four arithmetic basic operations bewteen binary values, I wrote this small aplication as a small Java challenge.

Currently (March 12 th, 2023), it already converts between the systems (decimal to nondecimal and vice-versa); but I'm stuck at the sum algorithm.

The algorithms for subtraction, multiplication and division aren't yet written.
